# MC Corrections


## TT correction
For the MC Correction of the TT samples `mc_corr.py` needs to be run with the channel `tt`.
The correction is derived using `mccorr_derive.py` and plots can be created with `makePlots_mccorr.py`.
The corrections for TT should be derived first, because they are used for correcting the DY samples.


## DY Correction

For the MC Correction of the TT samples `mc_corr.py` needs to be run with the channel `mumu`.
The correction is derived using `mccorr_derive.py` and plots can be created with `makePlots_mccorr.py`.
